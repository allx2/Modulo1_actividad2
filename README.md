The way that you have to publish your github web site has changed.

Now it requires a few more steps than we saw on the video

### Setting up repository

Publish your github site not longer require add a suffix `github.io`.

Now we have to set up the repository:

1. Click on settings  
2. Go to Github pages section  
3. Choose the branch and directory that contain the web page

>`theme: jekyll-theme-hacker`

and push into the repository
